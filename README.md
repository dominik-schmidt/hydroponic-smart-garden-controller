# Hydropomic Smart Garden Controller

Controller and web UI for a modified
[IDOO hydroponic growing system](https://www.idooworld.com/collections/hydroponics-grow-planter/products/idoo-indoor-garden-starter-kit-7-pods) using an ESP8266 microcontroller.

IDOO's hydroponic systems are controlled using on-device buttons. This project
replaces all circuit boards with an ESP8266 microcontroller
plus some additional electronics to control LEDs and pump.

This allows for remote control via a web UI and custom LED and pump settings. In
addition, this project could easily be extended using sensors, for example to
check water or nutrition levels.

That said, the main motivation for this modification was that the original IDOO 
circuit boards suffered from water damage, thus bricking the system.

## Installation

The [web UI](src/ui) is written in HTML and CSS. A custom
[parser](tools/parse-html.js) then turns HTML into C code (essentially a series of
`Serial.println` statements). The parser replaces some HTML elements with
dedicated function calls to render dynamic states (e.g., for toggles). It also points the
stylesheet link to an external host (configured in [package.json](package.json)).

The scenes (normal, grow, enjoy) replicate IDOO's original light and timing
settings (but are based on absolute clock times). If light mode is set to auto,
these timing settings are used. If set to on or off, lights are permanently on
or off. The pump turns on and off every 30 minutes if set to auto.

### Prepare UI
1. Upload [css](css) and [images](images) folders to a public host
1. Set `host` accordingly in [package.json](package.json) (e.g., "https://my.cdn.com/files")
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run make` to generate C code that renders HTML

### Configure Controller
1. Download and install the [Ardunio IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
1. Edit [sketch file](src/sketch/controller/controller.ino)
   - Set Wifi `ssid` and `password`
   - Set pins (`PIN_LED_RED`, `PIN_LED_BlUE`, `PIN_PUMP`)
   - Put generated C code from output/html-doc.c at the bottom of the sketch
1. Upload to microcontroller

### Test
1. Open Arduino IDE's serial monitor
1. Retrieve IP address and open in browser (e.g., http://192.168.1.68)

## Hardware

All components but the two original circuit boards (one in the base unit and
one in the lamp shade) are re-usedâ€”in particular LEDs, pump, power adapter, and
some of the wiring. Note that the top-buttons are non-functional after the
modification.

This setup is in parts still a bit crude, but it works. It uses the original 24V
power supply and a DC-DC converter to power the ESP8266. Three MOSFETs (IRLZ
44N) control LEDs (two colors: red and blue) and pump. Using a standard Ethernet
cable between the main module and the custom connector allows for some flexibility.
